        <h2>Grassroots Infrastructure</h2>

        <p>The Grassroots Infrastructure is a set of computing tools to allow users and developers to perform
            many scientific tasks as easily as possible. These tools are accessible via a web connection so are
            accessible for anyone with an internet connection. All of the data is sent as JSON messages so any server or
            client that can understand these JSON messages can be used to access the Grassroots Infrastructure . For example, you can use a web
            browser or the included Qt-based desktop client to access all of the functionality of the system. The
            scientific data is what is important, not the user's choice of tool to access the system.</p>
